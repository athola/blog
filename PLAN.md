# Project Roadmap

This document outlines the future direction for the blog engine, focusing on planned features and technical improvements.

## Near-Term: Reader Experience

The immediate priority is to enhance the core reading experience.

-   **Theme Toggle:** Implement a user-configurable dark/light mode to improve readability in different lighting conditions.
-   **Syntax Highlighting:** Add server-rendered code block highlighting to improve the presentation of technical articles.
-   **Post Search:** Implement a fast, server-side search function based on a pre-built index for efficient post discovery.
-   **Related Articles:** Display a list of related posts based on shared tags or content similarity to encourage further reading.

## Mid-Term: Community Features

These features are planned to add more interactive capabilities to the platform.

-   **Self-Hosted Comments:** A simple, self-hosted commenting system to keep the platform self-contained and avoid third-party services.
-   **Social Sharing:** Lightweight sharing links for email and social media that do not rely on external JavaScript widgets.
-   **Newsletter Signup:** A basic form for newsletter subscriptions.

## Long-Term: Content Management & Advanced Features

Longer-term goals are focused on improving content management and exploring new technologies.

-   **Minimal Admin Interface:** A basic, password-protected web interface for writing and managing posts, reducing the need for manual file edits and redeployments.
-   **PWA Support:** Add Progressive Web App features to allow for offline reading.
-   **AI Experiments:** Explore the use of local AI models for features like content summarization or tag suggestions. This is considered experimental and is a low priority.
