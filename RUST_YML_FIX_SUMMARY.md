# Rust.yml Workflow Fix Summary

## 🐛 Problem Identified

The GitHub Actions workflow file `.github/workflows/rust.yml` had an invalid structure where the `pull_request` event was incorrectly placed under the `permissions` section instead of being a sibling to the `push` event in the `on:` section.

## 🔧 Root Cause

**Invalid Structure (Before):**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    # ... push configuration

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull_request:  # ❌ INVALID - pull_request should be under 'on:'
    # ... pull_request configuration
```

**Correct Structure (After):**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    # ... push configuration
  pull_request:  # ✅ CORRECT - sibling to push under 'on:'
    # ... pull_request configuration

permissions:
  contents: read
```

## ✅ Fix Applied

1. **Moved `pull_request` event** from under `permissions` to under `on:`
2. **Maintained all existing configuration** for both `push` and `pull_request` events
3. **Preserved the `permissions` section** with only `contents: read`
4. **Kept all existing jobs and environment variables** intact

## 📋 Validation

The workflow now follows the correct GitHub Actions syntax:
- ✅ `on:` section contains both `push` and `pull_request` events
- ✅ `permissions:` section contains only permission settings
- ✅ All jobs and environment variables are preserved
- ✅ Path filtering and branch restrictions remain unchanged

## 🚀 Impact

This fix resolves:
- **CI/CD pipeline failures** due to invalid workflow syntax
- **Pull request validation** that was previously not triggered
- **Proper event handling** for both pushes and pull requests

The workflow will now correctly:
- Run on pushes to master branch
- Run on pull requests opened/synchronized against master
- Apply appropriate path filtering for both event types
- Maintain all existing CI checks and validations
