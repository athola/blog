refactor(tests): optimize integration testing strategy

- Remove separate CI-optimized test file (server_integration_tests_ci.rs)
- Consolidate integration tests into single optimized test suite
- Remove conditional compilation attributes to enable all tests in CI
- Optimize server_integration_tests.rs for CI performance:
  * Reduce timeouts for faster feedback
  * Improve resource management and process handling
  * Enhance error handling and debugging output
- Update GitHub Actions workflow to exclude heavy tests from coverage
- Maintain three-tier testing approach:
  * Unit tests (fastest)
  * Integration tests (optimized for CI)
  * Full integration tests (excluded from coverage)

This change simplifies the test infrastructure by having a single well-optimized
integration test suite that works across all environments rather than maintaining
separate test files for different contexts. The full integration tests are still
available but excluded from coverage analysis in CI to save resources.
