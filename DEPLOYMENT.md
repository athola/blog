# DigitalOcean Deployment Guide for alexthola.com

This guide walks through deploying the Rust/Leptos blog application to DigitalOcean App Platform with custom domain setup.

## Prerequisites

1. **DigitalOcean Account** with billing enabled
2. **Domain ownership** of `alexthola.com` 
3. **GitHub repository** with proper access permissions
4. **SurrealDB instance** (managed or self-hosted)

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Prepare Your Repository

Ensure all deployment files are committed:

```bash
git add .do/ Dockerfile DEPLOYMENT.md .env.production
git commit -m "Add DigitalOcean deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Create DigitalOcean App

#### Option A: Using the Web Interface

1. Log into [DigitalOcean Control Panel](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps)
2. Click **"Create App"**
3. Choose **"GitHub"** as source
4. Select repository: `athola/blog`
5. Choose branch: `main`
6. Upload the app spec: `.do/app.yaml`

#### Option B: Using doctl CLI

```bash
# Install doctl if not already installed
curl -sL https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl/releases/download/v1.100.0/doctl-1.100.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar -xzv
sudo mv doctl /usr/local/bin

# Authenticate
doctl auth init

# Create the app
doctl apps create --spec .do/app.yaml
```

### 3. Configure Database

#### Option A: Managed PostgreSQL (Recommended for production)

1. In DigitalOcean control panel, go to **Databases**
2. Create a new **PostgreSQL** cluster:
   - Name: `blog-database`
   - Version: `15`
   - Size: `db-s-1vcpu-1gb` (can scale later)
   - Region: Same as your app (e.g., `nyc3`)
3. Add your app to the database's trusted sources
4. Update environment variables in App Platform with connection details

#### Option B: Self-hosted SurrealDB

```bash
# On your database server
docker run --rm --pull always \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v /path/to/data:/data \
  surrealdb/surrealdb:latest start \
  --log info \
  --user root \
  --pass YOUR_SECURE_PASSWORD \
  file:/data/database.db
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

In DigitalOcean App Platform, set these environment variables:

```bash
# Required for application
RUST_LOG=info
LEPTOS_SITE_ADDR=0.0.0.0:8080
LEPTOS_SITE_ROOT=site
LEPTOS_HASH_FILES=true

# Database configuration
SURREAL_ADDRESS=http://your-database-url:8000
SURREAL_NS=production
SURREAL_DB=alexthola_blog
SURREAL_USERNAME=admin
SURREAL_PASSWORD=your-secure-password  # Mark as secret
```

### 5. Domain Configuration

#### Set Up DNS Records

In your domain registrar (e.g., Namecheap, GoDaddy), set these DNS records:

```dns
# A Records pointing to DigitalOcean
A     @           your-app-ip-address
A     www         your-app-ip-address

# Or use CNAME if you prefer
CNAME @           your-app.ondigitalocean.app
CNAME www         your-app.ondigitalocean.app
```

#### Configure Custom Domain in DigitalOcean

1. Go to your app in DigitalOcean App Platform
2. Click **"Settings"** â†’ **"Domains"**
3. Click **"Add Domain"**
4. Enter: `alexthola.com`
5. Add another domain: `www.alexthola.com` (as alias)
6. DigitalOcean will automatically provision SSL certificates

### 6. Database Migrations

Migrations will run automatically as a pre-deploy job. To run manually:

```bash
# If using SurrealDB
surreal import --conn $SURREAL_ADDRESS \
  --user $SURREAL_USERNAME \
  --pass $SURREAL_PASSWORD \
  --ns $SURREAL_NS \
  --db $SURREAL_DB \
  ./migrations/
```

### 7. Deployment Verification

Once deployed, verify the application:

```bash
# Health check
curl -f https://alexthola.com/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-XX...",
  "service": "blog-api",
  "version": "0.1.0"
}

# Check main site
curl -I https://alexthola.com
# Expected: 200 OK with proper headers
```
