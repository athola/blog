## Reporting a Security Issue

Security is a top priority for this project. If you discover a security vulnerability, report it responsibly.

To report a security vulnerability, please email the details to [alexthola@gmail.com](mailto:alexthola@gmail.com). **Do not create a public GitHub issue.**

I will work with you to resolve the issue and coordinate its disclosure.
